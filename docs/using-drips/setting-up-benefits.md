title: Setting Up Benefits
---

Once a creator or developer has their Community set up, they're ready to
configure the benefits they're going to offer to supporters who purchase
member tokens and become paid supporters. This is exciting, because it's a way for creators
to give back and incentivize the community members who support them!

This guide will provide high-level details for creators on how to set up two common
types of benefits that they might wish to offer to their members:

(1) access to a gated (private) channel on the community's Discord server (if one exists) and 
(2) access to voting on community issues and polls in Snapshot.

## Understanding the Benefits Offered

A few important notes about member benefits:

First, offering benefits is entirely optional and not all creators / Communities will choose to do so. Users
can see a description of the benefits offered as part of the process of [purchasing a membership][pu]
and should carefully read the description there to understand the benefits being offered before completing
the purchase of a membership.

Second, offering access to a resource outside of Drips (e.g. a Discord server or Snapshot space) as a
benefit requires that the project creator be willing to set up and maintain that resource. This guide 
only explains how to connect Drips memberships to Discord and Snapshot. A full discussion of how to
set up, maintain and use them is beyond the scope of this guide, and users should pursue product-specific
documentation referenced in the links below.
