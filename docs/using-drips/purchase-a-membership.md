Using Drips, it's easy for any user to purchase a membership to a Community and receive 
a NFT membership token and gain access to any benefits that the membership includes.

If you're interested in becoming a supporter, but don't have a specific Community
in mind, you can head over to the [Explore Page][da] to browse the different Communities
which have memberships available for purchase on Drips.

The rest of this guide will assume that you've selected a Community you wish
to purchase a membership for, and will walk through the steps required to do so.

Ready to see how it works? Let's go!

## Purchase a Membership

Let's assume you know the Community you want to become a member of. First, navigate to the
page for that community in the Drips web app.

Next, click on the big "Join" button in the middle of that page.

Here you will decide on the amount of funds you wish to donate each month (30 days) to
support the community. The box will be pre-populated with the minimum, so whatever
amount you choose must be equal to or greater than this initial value (10 DAI / month 
in the example above).

You will also need to decide how much DAI you would like to "pre-pay" and lock up in the
member token NFT you will receive. Member tokens function like pre-paid phone cards, where
you must lock up DAI in them in advance to cover upcoming donations. However,
unlike a pre-paid phone card, you can always withdraw any DAI that is locked up in the
member token but has not yet been donated (i.e. any DAI that would be used to cover future
months).

Note that the amount to the right of "Pay" is the amount of DAI that will be withdrawn from 
your wallet and placed into the member token during this step, so make sure that you have 
that amount of DAI available in your wallet and that you are willing to spend it.

Once you have decided on values for the DAI Rate and Pre-pay amounts, click "Drip" to proceed.

If you don't already have a wallet (e.g. Metamask) connected, you will be prompted to do so.
Please connect a wallet to continue. You will then be prompted to confirm the transaction.
This will look different depending on the Wallet you're using, but an example of how it
looks in Metamask is shown below.

Once you confirm the transaction, you will need to wait for it to be sent to the Ethereum
blockchain and confirmed there as well. This typically takes between 30 seconds and 2 minutes.

Once the transaction has been confirmed, you will be sent back to the main project page. If
you would like to check that you received your member token, click on your Ethereum address
in the top right corner of the page. This should take you to the user page for your address.
To see the member tokens you currently hold, toggle the slider on the right from "Created" to
"Joined". You should see the NFT for the Community that you just joined displayed in the list.

That's it! You're now a token-holding member of the Community!
