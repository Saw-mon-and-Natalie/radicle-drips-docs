Using Drips, it's easy to set up a Community and raise funds from your fans.
If you wish, you can also specify and configure any benefits that members of your Community
will receive.

Let's jump in and see how it works!

## Create a Community

First, open a new browser tab and navigate to [https://drips.radicle.network/][da].

Next, click on the 'Create' button in the top right corner of the page.
</br>  
![Click Create][c1]
 
You will be prompted to connect a wallet. Go ahead and do so in order to proceed. The rest of this guide will assume the use of Metamask, but the steps are similar with other wallets.
</br>  
![Connect Your Wallet][c2]
 
Once a wallet has been connected, the "Create a Community" screen will appear.

Fill out basic information about your Community, including any links to social media accounts. Then click "Next".

On the next page you'll be able to configure details for the "member tokens" (NFT membership badges) that your supporters will receive. A few notes:

- *Minimum subscription* is the minimum monthly funding amount that supporters must commit to drip to you in order to become a member.
- *Token Symbol* is the symbol that will be associated with your member tokens, and is a standard value that all NFTs must define as part of the ERC-721 standard. If you're not certain about what to enter, you should choose a short text string that you feel represents your community. For instance, if the name of your community is "Computer Club", you might choose
"COMP" for the symbol.
- *Monthly Funding Goal* (optional) is a way for you to let your fans know the total amount of funds you hope to raise each month through Drips.
- *Custom Token Image IPFS Hash* (optional) allows you define a custom image that will appear on your community's member tokens when they are viewed in the Drips web app, or on sites like Opensea, by entering the hash of the image in IPFS. Instructions on how to upload an image to IPFS are beyond the scope of this guide, and in order to use this functionality it is probably best to be an advanced user.
