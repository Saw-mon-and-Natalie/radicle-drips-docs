## I'm a creator/developer. How do I raise funds using Drips?
Head over to the [Create a Community][cc] section for instructions on how to
set up your Community and issue member tokens for your fans to purchase.

## I want to purchase a membership to a Community I'm a fan of. How do I do that?
Please seet the [Purchase a Membership][pm] section for instructions on how to
purchase a membership token for a Community you wish to support.

## Is it posssible to drip funds using ETH or an ERC-20 token other than DAI?
In the current version of Drips, DAI is the only token that can be dripped to other
users or Communities. However the Drips team is actively working to add support for
dripping other types of tokens in the next version of the protocol.
