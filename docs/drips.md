Drips is a new Ethereum protocol that allows any creator to generate continuous income from their communities without relying on bank accounts or extracting platforms. 

Using Drips, creators & developers can issue monthly memberships and give their fans unique benefits in exchange for their recurring financial support. Using the permissionless financial infrastructure of Ethereum, Drips memberships are represented by Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). These memberships are available to anyone and can enable benefits across any application on the web that supports Ethereum (Discord, Telegram, Reddit, Snapshot, Radicle Upstream & many more).

Fans can support and engage with their favorite creators and communities by purchasing memberships and by “dripping” funds to any address in the network in recurring configurable intervals.

Finally, Drips allow creators to automatically spread the love every time they get paid by specifying a percentage of their incoming funds to be dripped to other users. The recipient could be a charity, another collective, or another software dependency or creator that makes their work possible. Sharing funds through Drips has the potential to become a new culture norm and building block for a sustainable crypto economy.

## How It Works

1. A creator or developer sets a funding goal and minimum supporter contribution and creates a Community using the Drips web app at [drips.radicle.network][]. Behind the scenes, the new Community is actually deployed to the Ethereum blockchain as an ERC-721 contract, which is 100% owned and controlled by the creator.

2. Next, the creator must decide on the benefits (if any) they wish to offer to supporters who purchase memberships. Examples of benefits include [access to gated Discord channels][] or the ability to [participate in governance polls using Snapshot][].

3. Community members who wish to purchase memberships and "Drip" to the creator can do so by navigating to the page for the new Community in the Drips web app and clicking "Fund". They will then be prompted to choose an amount of DAI they would like to donate and also an amount of DIA that they would like to set aside in advance to use for payment, and an NFT membership badge is minted and sent to their Ethereum address. The NFT serves as both a badge of support and also a key that unlocks access to the benefits offered.

4. Finally, the creator can choose to "spread the love" by specifying percentages of incoming funds that will be dripped onwards to other users. Recipients of these drip "shares" could be contributors, charities, or other projects or Communities that they Community depends upon (e.g. a software library dependency).
